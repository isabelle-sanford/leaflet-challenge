# Leaflet Challenge - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

![1-Logo](Images/1-Logo.png)

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.


### Level 1: Basic Visualization

1. **The Data**

   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. The [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page has several datasets; the current one displayed is 'Earthquakes above 1.0 from the Past Week'.


2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

   This map was created using Leaflet.js, and all of the earthquakes from the data set above based on their longitude and latitude.

   * The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and a darker red in color.

   * The map also includes popups that provide the exact magnitude of the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
